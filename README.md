InfoTap is a G2C communication channel, by which Government sectors can communicate directly to Aadhaar card holding citizens.

Citizens can register using their Aadhaar cards and authenticate themselves using a OTP.
Registered citizens get personalized as well as public notifications such as:

<ul><li>Area specific info for citizenâ€™s locality</li>
<li>On time awareness on public issues such as power cuts, transport etc.</li>
<li>Personal bills and financial alerts</li>
<li>Healthcare information such as free medical camps, polio drops etc</li>
<li>Emergency alert such as natural disasters and safety tips</li>
</ul>

Users can select their preferred departments such as Electricity, Police etc and receive only those particular updates.

InfoTap can help government give real time alerts to everyone and save time and money in the process. Citizens can be benefited by hustle free, one spot message board for public and personal govt. alerts.
